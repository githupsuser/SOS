actual: V1.1
ToDo:
* U28 Pin 5 to VSDcard
* swap SCL4 and SDA4
* Disable U6B (Pin 6)
* remove footprint J37 (SMA)
* correct footprint U4
* correct footprint of U22
* connect VDDSMPS fo VCC with 10µF and separate from VDD11
* connect PA8 with PA9
* separate GND SMPS pin 48 to C60/61
* diode from U7_VCC (K) to VCCraw (A)
* Cap between VUSB and GND (near D17)
* CM Choke between SPE_PWR/GND and VUSB/GND
* check: Hole 0,8 mm ? for pin sockets J23 ..30 and J25..28
* Hole 0,9 mm for pin header K23 ..30 and K25..28
* add series resistors 22 Ohm to ADIN1110 SPI, Int. and Capt. lines
* bigger footprint for L10 for higher saturation current
* check foorprint of L6
* check 10n for C2, C4, C6, C8, C10, C21, C22
* add 10µF on VSDcard
* add placing support for U21 and U22
* separate Shield from Earth on J14 and J15
* Change J18 IPEX MHF I for prize reduction (CONMHF1-SMD-G-T)
* 10k thin 0805 -> 0605 for prize reduction
* C15..18 1206 -> 0805 for prize reduction (e.g. GRM2165C2A103JA01D)
* change Reset-Switch for prize reduction (e.g. PTS815)
* R146 also 0805 or all 300k in 0603
* add polarity symbols on back mask for J1 and J2
* increase text on back mask
* NPTH and smaller dia for nSIM latch holes
* add test pin on ADCdrdy, SCK1
* smaller reference circles
* move RI to WKUP (PB5 or PB8) to support Standby mode (EXTI up to Stop 3)
* RI is active low (RI -> /RI)
* add CS on SDO, see Q28 on Mic
